  <h1> Welcome to my new Blog!</h1>
  <p> Now you all might be wondering why I stopped using my old blog or why my new blog looks so terrible and that's a fair question. But the truth is i'm putting my free time here to good use: I'm learning how to code! So everything on this website has been coded from scratch by me! So I hope you all enjoy my new blog.
