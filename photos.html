    <p id=whip> So first picture has got to be a tribute to the bike that carries me everywhere. So here's a tribute to the whip.</p>

    <p id=printer>Now this may look like just a random printer. BUT this was actually what they used to print our receipt at a department store. It blew my mind. </p>

    <p id=fest>If you thought there wouldn't be a band covering classic American songs at a potato festival then you'd be wrong.</p>

      <h3>Here's a compilation of all my photos from Hamburg:</h3>
      <p>Here's the Elbi! The philharmonic concert hall of Hamburg. There are some beautiful views from here which I of course didn't take pictures of.</p>
      <img src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LqeJt4wi2VI/WgMx4lhj4yI/AAAAAAAAABM/Q5miPxdKBkoooOtWl3dFmIeBLKwYwDWngCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/IMG_6807.JPG height=300 width=400 />
      <div>
        <p>This is where the Fischmarkt takes place! It's essentially a giant streetfair that only takes place early on Sunday morning.</p>

        <p>Companies in Germany sponsored floats in the pride parade and they threw little packets of branded gummy bears!</p>

        <p>It's apparently also a thing in Hamburg to put locks on bridges to symbolize love. this is a common sight at just about every bridge. What I want to know is if a couple gets divorced does someone come and cut the lock off the bridge? Or does it sit there and rust as some sort of symbol? If anyone knows the answer let me know.</p>

        <p>They don't just have bagged milk here. They have boxed milk too! And the wildest thing is you don't even have to refrigerate this milk.</p>
