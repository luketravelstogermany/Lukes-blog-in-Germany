      <h3>Week 1</h3>
      <p>Guten Morgen! <div></div>

Or it's at least morning where I am. Back in New York it's about midnight so when most of you read this it'll make sense. So far the first few days have been quite interesting. On Wednesday I had pre-departure orientation in Washington DC. That consisted mainly of lectures that were quite boring although I did get to meet the chief of staff of our representative, Sean Patrick Maloney for those of you who didn't know, and we all went to the German Embassy to meet one of the staff members there. I don't remember his name but he was a good public speaker and very entertaining. On Friday we finally left for the airport, our flight took off at around 4 in the afternoon and we arrived in Frankfurt at around 5:30 AM local time. Most of us didn't sleep on the flight because we were too excited to finally be in Germany so we had to force ourselves to stay awake. We also had to take public transportation to the language camp so picture 50 students bringing their luggage through first the subway then on a bus. It was quite the sight. Upon arrival at language camp we were introduced to our supervisors who I'm sure i'll have more stories about once we get to know them better. Sunday we had a good amount of free time so we made friends with two German kids Leo and Sammy, we played soccer with them for about two hours which was very fun although they were much better than we were despite the fact that they were only 10 and 11 respectively. So what I've learned about German meals so far is that they eat the same thing for both breakfast and dinner; Bread with meats and cheese (cold cuts), butter, Nutella, and other assorted fixings. I love this because of the consistency. Some kids say they're getting tired of the bread but that's impossible. Some other random information about where I'm staying for the language camp is that there're pool, fooseball, and ping pong tables. So there's quite a bit to keep us entertained. Although we don't need to entertain ourselves often; we have language classes from 9:30 to 12:45 then we have lunch from 1:15-2:15 and after that we've had afternoon activities everyday. For example, one day we went to town hall which was a beautiful building that surprisingly survived both world wars and on another day we went to the spice museum which is exactly what it sounds like. The spice museum was a little boring but I did learn some information so it was worth it. Overall I rate my first week as a success and I'm sure all have plenty of new stories to tell by next week.

      <p> Guten Tag!
<div></div>
Language camp is now officially half-way over and so far I've had a blast! Here are the highlights from the past week: Last Saturday we went to the city of Lubeck which was wild from start to finish. First of all in Germany for longer distance train trips they have double Decker trains which I had never even seen before. So that was lots of fun to experience. Then we got a tour of the city which had all the picturesque German buildings. Also, most of the streets in Germany are still cobblestone which adds a nice medieval feel to every city. At the end of the tour we went to this beautiful Lutheran church. It had those paintings of biblical figures with the gold backing and no concept of three dimensional drawing. Those are always nice to see. I took some pictures but I'm writing this on my laptop and the pictures are on my Ipod so I think i'll make a photo album. It also had massive high ceilings that made everything echo beautifully. Anyway, that was Lubeck on Saturday. On Sunday we learned how to play German Dodge ball which is very fun and I can't wait to teach everyone how to play in the US. When the week started we went back to language camp which is immensely helpful so far. I've learned an absurd amount of German in just two weeks so I can now carry out some basic functions like ordering and paying for food. The schedule this week stayed the same from last weeks so we've been having all our activities in the afternoon. One of the best things we did this week was visit the U.S. consulate in Hamburg. There we got to listen to a band comprised entirely of Syrian refugees that was incredible. Then we got to hear the consulate general speak and talk to him after the speech. It was great to hear his life story and he was a hilarious guy in general. Then the next day we went to this giant carnival in Hamburg called Hamburger Dom and that was also lots of fun. I didn't ride any rides (mainly because I don't like them) but I had fun just wandering around. Then Thursday we had Bingo night and this week the theme was formal. So I wore a bow tie over my pajamas. I didn't win bingo this week but it was still fun anyway. Lastly, yesterday we went to the city of Bremen which was a cool mix of old and new buildings. It was nice juxtaposition. The streets were packed however because we happened to be there for the Bremen pride parade. There was a lot of dancing in the street which was fun and for once we weren't the largest group in one area so that was nice too. In summary I would also rate week two as a success.

      <h3>Week 3</h3>
      <p>Moin, 
<div></div>
There are only five full days of language camp left and that's an odd feeling for me. It seemed so far away and now it feels done in almost an instant. But anyway this week was also packed with activities. The first half of the day is still the same with breakfast then language camp then lunch and a different activity in the afternoon. On Monday we went to the German museum of emigrants. Not immigrants. It was fascinating to see a museum that focused on the journey of people before they left their home country; not one focused on the lives of people after they arrived in a new one. Of course the museum took some time to fire some shots at the U.S. for its stance on immigration which was hilarious. Then on Tuesday for some unknown reason one of our vocab words was the German word for "to baste." For those of you curious it's heften. I'm still unsure why that was one of the first verbs we needed to learn. On Wednesday we got a tour of a bunker underground right next to Central Station in Hamburg. It was built during the cold war and is used as a reminder of the catastrophe that nuclear war can bring. It was a very good and informative tour but the bunker was very cold because of how deep underground it was. On Thursday we went to a street fair surrounding the lake next to the Rathaus (town hall). German street fairs are very similar to New York ones except they're in German which makes them slightly cooler. On Friday we had another fascinating tour; a tour of the different services that are offered to the homeless in Hamburg. The tour is given by a man who lived on the street for seven years. It was a powerful to witness. It brings to the forefront of your mind all the struggles that the homeless face in a big city like Hamburg. Then on Saturday we went to another smaller city called Celle. Once again we took a double decker train there however, I was told that apparently those are a thing in the U.S. but I'm still fascinated by them. In Celle we got to meet the mayor although none of us are really sure why. That's alright because he was a charismatic guy and fun to hear speak. After that we got a tour of the city which was beautiful. Celle is a stereotypical European city with many buildings that date back to the 15 and 16 hundreds. It also had a castle that we got to tour as well. The castle was not what I expected to be but it was still cool. Finally to end yesterday we had a barbecue with the American football team in Celle. They're called the Stallions and it was nice to throw around a football again. So overall my first three weeks in Germany have been a blast.

      <h3>Week 4</h3>
      <p>Moin, 
<div></div>
So I have officially been in Germany for one month and this last week was a very interesting one. On Tuesday after Spracheschule we went to the Hamburg museum which was very interesting because we got to do a scavenger hunt for certain objects. I learned about the sugar making progress because apparently Hamburg used to be a huge exporter of sugar. I also learned that there was a large fire in Hamburg that was so hot it fused glass, porcelain and metal together. After the museum we went to German walmart (yeah it's a thing. Even though it's not called walmart it is a walmart.) and we discovered multiple things. First, cool ranch Doritos are called cool american. No joke. Second, kinder eggs are wild. They're chocolate eggs with toys inside which are amazing. On Wednesday we went to the Michaelekirche (I think that's how it's spelled) which is a beautiful Lutheran church located close to the center of Hamburg. It's about 457 stairs to the top of the tower on the church but once you're up there you can see the entire city and it's quite amazing. Then on Thursday for our last full day at the hostel we had a dance. That was pretty fun although I didn't dance much. I doubt this comes as much of a surprise. But on Friday it was finally time to move in with my host family. I am one of the few people living close enough to Hamburg to get picked up by their host family. So by the time my host mother came most of the others had left for their trains. The first car ride wasn't nearly as awkward as I had expected it to be and I got to ride on the autobahn. For those of you who are curious there is still no speed limit on most parts. But anyway I finally got to use my newly acquired German. It was naturally inadequate but not nearly as much as I expected it to be. So here are some interesting things about Rolfsen. First, I've been spelling it wrong this entire time. Whoops. Second, four out of five days school ends at 1 so I eat lunch at home with my family. Third, very few people here speak English which is great because it is forcing me to always use German. Fourth, on Friday I went to my first marching band practice which was great. I was very happy to play the flute again. Fifth almost all the cars here are stick shift so it's been an experience getting used to that. Sixth and finally, chickens are hilarious. My host family has chickens and I laugh every time I see them just walking around. I don't know how to explain it but they are just funny. So now that the language camp is over it's time for the real exchange to begin. I'm very excited for the next 10 months.

      <h3>Week 5</h3>
      <p>Guten Tag, 
<div></div>
So my first official week of living with my host family has come to a close and it has been wonderful so far. On Sunday there was a little parade through one of the neighboring villages. There were a bunch of intricate floats built by the locals that were impressive. After the parade there was a street fair as well and while I didn't buy anything it was still fun to walk around with my host family. Then Monday was my first day of German high school. That was fascinating. So the school structure here is very different from that in the United States. The way it works is I have 3 hour and a half blocks of instruction with 20 minute breaks in between. So everyday I only have three classes for an hour and a half each. And even though school starts at 7:50 I'm home by about 1:20 in the afternoon. It's pretty great. My actual classes are art, Spanish, English, Math, German, Nawi (science), Porta (project work), religion, and Geschikte (a mix of history, politics and discussion). As of yet I don't understand much in my classes aside from in English, math, and Spanish but that's alright it'll get better. My main class group is very rambunctious but they're also very entertaining so it's a good mix. Rolfsen itself is very beautiful. It's a small farming village with bike paths everywhere so I love to go bike riding and just take in the scenery. It's peaceful here. Also, the fresh eggs from the chickens are quite tasty. So that was my first week. Yesterday I spent most of my day painting the fence in our front yard. But then after that we had a "block party" (the quotes are because there were about 12 people there in total). That was lots of fun and it was good to meet my neighbors. Overall, the first week in Rolfsen has been a good one.

      <h3>Week 6</h3>
      <p>Moin,
<div></div>
So this week I think was the first week I started to find my groove. I've actually started consistently socializing with people and I can now moderately well maintain a basic conversation. Killin' the game. I also think I passed my Spanish test (Gracias Profe) mainly because it was all in Spanish so I didn't have to worry about not understanding the German directions. I also took my first math test which did not go as well mainly because it was difficult to understand what the questions were asking. But everyday school gets a little bit easier. In terms of things outside of school this week was also entertaining. My Thursday church choir got a new member, she's a girl who lives in a nearby village and she brings the number of people there under 50 to a grand total of 3. But that's alright because the people here are all very nice and entertaining. I also had marching band this week and that was also good. It feels great to keep playing the flute. Last weekend my host family and I went to a festival in one of the nearby villages and that was pretty cool. It was like a street fair but in German so that adds a whole new level of interesting.  I've also learned some new important things about the German language: 
<div></div>
First: This week I learned the word for Juxtaposition. It's "Nebeneinander" 
Second: The German language has relatively little slang. That's a little disappointing as I use slang a lot. 
Third: Many German words have multiple meanings. For example the word An can mean To, On, At, By, About, or Against depending on the context it's used in. So that's fun. 
<div></div>
So those have been the highlights of my week so far. Things have pretty much calmed down since arrival in Rolfsen. 
<div></div>
All the best,
Luke</p>

      <h3>Week 7</h3>
      <p>Hallo,
<div></div>
First of all this week I experienced a life changing discovery: Spreadable meat is a real thing. Now this is something I'd never encountered before but it is amazing and I highly recommend it. But anyway, this was an interesting week. My usual 10th grade class was not in session this week because they had what is called a Praktikum. So essentially this week instead of going to school they all had a week of job training in a field of their interest. That's pretty cool except I'm new here and don't speak all that much German so instead of doing that I went to school with my host brother. That was still interesting. Last weekend Germany had its Bundestag elections so in school we talked about that during our history course. That was cool and I understand part of the class. Other highlights of the week include taking an English test on Friday which was naturally very easy, joining a new choir this week where I'm literally the only one there under 50, getting this really good pastry called Franbrotchen from the convenience store near my school, and eating German pizza. So interesting thing about Germany; they put their toppings underneath the cheese on the pizza. Now this took me by surprise but it's not bad. I also had an interesting time explaining this to my host family. Those are the interesting things that occurred this week in Rolfsen. Also, I've established a daily routine of going for a bike ride after school and it is quite beautiful here. There are fields that spread for miles, only broken up by small villages or forests of huge coniferous trees. It's a great place to be.

All the best,
