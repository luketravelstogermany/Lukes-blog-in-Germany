Or it's at least morning where I am. Back in New York it's about midnight so when most of you read this it'll make sense. So far the first few days have been quite interesting. On Wednesday I had pre-departure orientation in Washington DC. That consisted mainly of lectures that were quite boring although I did get to meet the chief of staff of our representative, Sean Patrick Maloney for those of you who didn't know, and we all went to the German Embassy to meet one of the staff members there. I don't remember his name but he was a good public speaker and very entertaining. On Friday we finally left for the airport, our flight took off at around 4 in the afternoon and we arrived in Frankfurt at around 5:30 AM local time. Most of us didn't sleep on the flight because we were too excited to finally be in Germany so we had to force ourselves to stay awake. We also had to take public transportation to the language camp so picture 50 students bringing their luggage through first the subway then on a bus. It was quite the sight. Upon arrival at language camp we were introduced to our supervisors who I'm sure i'll have more stories about once we get to know them better. Sunday we had a good amount of free time so we made friends with two German kids Leo and Sammy, we played soccer with them for about two hours which was very fun although they were much better than we were despite the fact that they were only 10 and 11 respectively. So what I've learned about German meals so far is that they eat the same thing for both breakfast and dinner; Bread with meats and cheese (cold cuts), butter, Nutella, and other assorted fixings. I love this because of the consistency. Some kids say they're getting tired of the bread but that's impossible. Some other random information about where I'm staying for the language camp is that there're pool, fooseball, and ping pong tables. So there's quite a bit to keep us entertained. Although we don't need to entertain ourselves often; we have language classes from 9:30 to 12:45 then we have lunch from 1:15-2:15 and after that we've had afternoon activities everyday. For example, one day we went to town hall which was a beautiful building that surprisingly survived both world wars and on another day we went to the spice museum which is exactly what it sounds like. The spice museum was a little boring but I did learn some information so it was worth it. Overall I rate my first week as a success and I'm sure all have plenty of new stories to tell by next week.

Language camp is now officially half-way over and so far I've had a blast! Here are the highlights from the past week: Last Saturday we went to the city of Lubeck which was wild from start to finish. First of all in Germany for longer distance train trips they have double Decker trains which I had never even seen before. So that was lots of fun to experience. Then we got a tour of the city which had all the picturesque German buildings. Also, most of the streets in Germany are still cobblestone which adds a nice medieval feel to every city. At the end of the tour we went to this beautiful Lutheran church. It had those paintings of biblical figures with the gold backing and no concept of three dimensional drawing. Those are always nice to see. I took some pictures but I'm writing this on my laptop and the pictures are on my Ipod so I think i'll make a photo album. It also had massive high ceilings that made everything echo beautifully. Anyway, that was Lubeck on Saturday. On Sunday we learned how to play German Dodge ball which is very fun and I can't wait to teach everyone how to play in the US. When the week started we went back to language camp which is immensely helpful so far. I've learned an absurd amount of German in just two weeks so I can now carry out some basic functions like ordering and paying for food. The schedule this week stayed the same from last weeks so we've been having all our activities in the afternoon. One of the best things we did this week was visit the U.S. consulate in Hamburg. There we got to listen to a band comprised entirely of Syrian refugees that was incredible. Then we got to hear the consulate general speak and talk to him after the speech. It was great to hear his life story and he was a hilarious guy in general. Then the next day we went to this giant carnival in Hamburg called Hamburger Dom and that was also lots of fun. I didn't ride any rides (mainly because I don't like them) but I had fun just wandering around. Then Thursday we had Bingo night and this week the theme was formal. So I wore a bow tie over my pajamas. I didn't win bingo this week but it was still fun anyway. Lastly, yesterday we went to the city of Bremen which was a cool mix of old and new buildings. It was nice juxtaposition. The streets were packed however because we happened to be there for the Bremen pride parade. There was a lot of dancing in the street which was fun and for once we weren't the largest group in one area so that was nice too. In summary I would also rate week two as a success.
